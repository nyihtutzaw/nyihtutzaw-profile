          I am an experienced developer who began my career while attending university, starting with freelance projects sourced online and through referrals. During my university years, I joined Felis Studio, a Mandalay-based startup, as a full-stack developer working with Laravel, Vue.js, and Flutter. I also gained valuable experience at Nexstack as a development team lead, managing three teams totaling 12 developers across various projects.

As a development team lead for five years, I managed three junior developers while expanding my expertise in Docker, CI/CD, AWS, and project management. My core technical skills include React, Laravel, Express, and Flutter.
